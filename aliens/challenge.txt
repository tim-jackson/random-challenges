Alien invasion

Mad aliens are about to invade the earth and you are tasked with simulating the
invasion.

A map contains the names of cities in the non-existent world of X.
The map file contains one city per line, with the city name first, followed by
1-4 directions (north, south, east, or west). Each one represents a
road to another city that lies in that direction.

The city and each of the pairs are separated by a single space, and the
directions are separated from their respective cities with an equals (=) sign.

The program should create N aliens, where N is specified as a command-line argument.

The aliens should start out at random places on the map, and wander around randomly,
following links. On each iteration, the aliens can travel in any of the directions
leading out of a city.

When two aliens end up in the same place, they fight, and in the process kill
each other and destroy the city. When a city is destroyed, it is removed from
the map, and so are any roads that lead into or out of it.

Once a city is destroyed, aliens can no longer travel to or through it. This
may lead to aliens getting "trapped".

The program should read in the world map, create N aliens, and
unleash them. The program should run until all the aliens have been
destroyed, or each alien has moved at least 10,000 times. When two aliens
fight, print out a message like:

Bar has been destroyed by alien 10 and alien 34!

Once the simulation has finished, it should print out the world state in the
same format as the input file.
